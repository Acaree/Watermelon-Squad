# GunBird by Watermelon $quad


Gunbird is a shot ‘em up made in 1994 by Psikyo. The original game was released in arcade machines. In the game, we can choose one of the 5 playable characters. The game has 4 stages in random order and a final stage. Every stage consists in hordes of enemies and a final boss.

The plot of the game is about a magic mirror. This mirror is divided in 4 parts, and the full mirror gives a wish to its owner, after winning in a battle to Atler, the final boss based in Gizmo, the main character from Gremlins. You choose one character and you need to take the mirror pieces from a crew of pirates, the Trump. Each character has their own plotlines and different wishes to the magic mirror.
